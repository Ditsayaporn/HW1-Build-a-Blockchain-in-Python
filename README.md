# HW1-Build-a-Blockchain-in-Python
In this notebook we will implement various different aspects of Blockchain technology that we understand including:

● The Blockchain Data Structure using OOP
● A proof of work simulation
● Understanding of the concept of difficulty of finding the next blockhash
● A simulation of multiple miners with varying computational powers
● A bit of data analytics to see if what we've implemented makes sense
